            The traditional way of starting a seniors cohousing project is that
            a group of successful professionals who are close to retirement and
            have high financial and organizational resources buy land and build
            a cluster of houses close to each other. Every individual owns their
            place but all share common living areas. While this option works
            very well for individuals who have the resources to execute such a
            project, it is not feasible for the majority of seniors. Aisha Real
            Estate Development Inc. aims to develop cohousing communities that
            offer rental units to seniors. This way they can enjoy the benefits
            of cohousing without the need to go through the process of
            establishing the project itself or the financial burden of buying a
            unit in such a project.

            A cohousing community of one hundred individuals would be optimal. A
            community of one hundred seniors is large enough for seniors to
            socialize but not too large to know each other and bond together.
            What Aisha Real Estate Development Inc. aims to do is to establish a
            development which is an aggregation of these cohousing communities.
            So if we have an aggregation of 10 cohousing communities we will
            have a larger community of 1000 seniors. Regardless of the number of
            seniors in each cohousing community and the number of cohousing
            communities within the aggregation, the idea is to develop a
            structure where each cohousing community acts as a nucleus within
            this structure.

            Figure 1 shows a hypothetical model of such an aggregation in case
            of the number of cohousing communities is four and each community
            consists of five apartment buildings. The value of the proposed
            aggregation is that while the dynamic of the small cohousing
            community is preserved within each community, the bigger structure
            enables us to provide a set of services tailored specifically toward
            the seniors population. It is more economical and affordable to
            provide a specialized set of services to a collection of cohousing
            communities rather than to a single community.

            For instance there could be a common building that serves all
            cohousing communities in the project where all services needed by
            seniors could be found like: Medical center where geriatricians are
            the primary care doctors Gym with training programs developed
            specifically for seniors Restaurants and cafes. Entertainment center
            .A place for large social gatherings and seminars. Transportation
            service •Grocery store •More services could always be added when
            needed A guest house where seniors children and other family members
            could stay when they visit the seniors will be a great addition to
            the project.

            Understanding the needs of the seniors we target will allow them to
            age-in-place and use the platform I am suggesting to its full
            potential. So, while the majority of seniors do not need special
            care services, we could establish a facility dedicated to seniors
            who would need special care. The purpose of this facility is that if
            a senior needs change after joining the community, they would not
            need to look for another type of accommodation. It would be cruel to
            ask a senior who has lived in the community and established bonds
            with other seniors to leave when they are most vulnerable!

            Each cohousing community will have many options that suit the
            different needs for different seniors. The units could be a one
            bedroom or two bedrooms or even more. A senior could choose to share
            a unit with other seniors for social and financial convenience or
            live in a unit by themselves if the senior wishes but still within a
            larger community of seniors.

            I conducted a survey among 19 seniors and I found out that gardening
            was an activity that many seniors enjoyed and wanted to have
            wherever they live. So every cohousing community could have common
            green areas and houses rooftops could be converted into green houses
            where seniors can garden anytime of the year. And it is always fun
            to cook a meal using the food you grow with your friends and
            neighbors but we need first to have a community for activities like
            these to take place. This is just one example of how these
            communities will be developed around what seniors like to do and
            enjoy.

            Building the homes to be as accessible and as ”smart” as possible is
            one of my priorities. Support software and smart devices will make
            seniors life easier and more convenient. In addition to the
            convenience, smart technology adds a component of safety highly
            appreciated by seniors. So while seniors will enjoy the dynamic of
            the community while together, they will enjoy all the benefits that
            come with the new technology in their homes. Seniors who prefer to
            stay in their homes are more than welcome to visit! Senior tourists
            constitute a large percentage of the tourism market, which is
            expected to grow further with the retirement of baby boomers. When
            cohousing communities are developed the way I described in the
            previous section, we are actually establishing great destinations
            for senior tourists both Canadian and international.

            When seniors come for a short stay in these cohousing communities,
            they will not just enjoy the extraordinary beauty of nature that
            many Canadian cities offer, and the services that developed
            specifically for seniors but also the opportunity to make new
            friendships with the seniors who choose to live permanently in these
            communities. I expect many seniors will be frequent visitors of
            these communities which will add to the value of this design. The
            affordability of these communities will encourage a new hybrid life
            style for seniors where they spend part of their time in their homes
            and the rest with their new friends in the cohousing communities

            Another group of residents/visitors who will find these communities
            attractive are remote workers. With the rise of remote working as an
            option for many white collar employees, these new communities will
            present the perfect combination of a Work & Play life style. Many
            workers do not see the value in staying in over crowded and
            expensive cities while they can do their work remotely from places
            that give them the opportunity to enjoy life through a mixture of
            work and play.

            As Alberta is associated in our minds with oil I would like Ontario
            to be associated in the Canadians minds as the perfect place to
            spend their retirement. There are 6.5 million seniors in Canada and
            I want to convince one million of them to move to Ontario! As a
            province, as developers and businesses we need to rally around
            building as many as possible of the new communities I am suggesting
            and put Ontario on the national map as the dream land for seniors.
            When one million seniors call Ontario home, that means their family
            members will come to visit, say once a year, which means we will
            have few million tourists per year. Just imagine the businesses that
            will start around those tourists! This is just one aspect of the
            economy that will flourish and lead other aspects of the economy to

            It might seem on the surface that this project has the downside that
            the provincial government will have to spend on health care much
            more than it would normally do as the health care expenses for
            seniors are much higher than any other age group. However this is

            Cities like St. Catharines make Ontario the perfect fit for this

            The nature is breathtaking. Beautiful nature and reasonable weather
            are huge factors in the lives of seniors. The land is relatively
            cheaper than other provinces in Canada which makes this kind of
            unique developments economical and affordable. Vast areas of land
            surrounded by beautiful nature and close to the lakes are great
            factors for this project to succeed and attract seniors to come.

            So When seniors come to Ontario in large numbers, also young people
            will come to Ontario in large numbers to fill the jobs created in
            this new economy. Therefore we will have a more balanced population
            of old and young Canadians and both groups will increase the tax
            base which ultimately has a positive impact on the province. Also
            seniors do not have young children who require the province to
            invest in their education and health care. A side effect of such
            cohousing model is that if seniors decide to adapt this kind of
            living and sell their houses, there will be more houses available
            for younger Canadians. Basically it will solve the problem that
            seniors have too much housing while younger Canadians have too
            little housing.
